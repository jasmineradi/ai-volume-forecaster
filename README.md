# Week 7 – Quantitative AI Forecasting Project

This repository contains my Week 7 assignment. 
The project includes:

- Synthetic historical volume data generation  
- Statistical pattern analysis  
- Moving average forecasting  
- Exponential smoothing forecasting  
- Time series decomposition  
- Visualization output  
- Full written analysis  

## Project Files

### `forecast_report.md`
This is my full written analysis report for the assignment.  
It includes:
- Trend analysis  
- Weekly/monthly/yearly patterns  
- Forecasting method comparisons  
- Error analysis  
- Reflections and insights  

### `forecast_system.py`
Main Python script that:
- Loads the generated dataset  
- Computes statistical patterns  
- Runs forecasting models  
- Creates visualizations  
- Prints the forecast summary  

### `data/historical_volumes.csv`
Automatically generated dataset containing 3 years (1,095 days) of volume data.

### `volume_analysis.png`
Visualization of trends, weekly patterns, and monthly patterns generated by the script.

## How to Run the Project
To run the forecasting system, use the following command:

python forecast_system.py

Copy code


## Summary
All required components have been implemented, and the full analysis can be found inside `forecast_report.md`.

# Week 8 – Quantitative AI Forecasting System  
This section summarizes the Week 8 expansion of the project.

Week 8 extends the original statistical forecasting project into a full **Quantitative AI system** using machine learning models, ensemble mathematics, and probabilistic analysis.

## 📊 Week 8 Project Overview

This forecasting system now includes:

### Statistical Models (from Week 7)
- Moving Average (MA-7)
- Exponential Smoothing

### Machine Learning Models (new for Week 8)
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regression  
- XGBoost Regression  

These five models are combined through a **weighted ensemble** to generate a 13-month forecast with confidence intervals and validated performance metrics.
