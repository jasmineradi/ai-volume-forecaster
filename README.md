## Project Files

### `forecast_report.md`
This is my full written analysis report for the assignment.  
It includes:
- Trend analysis  
- Weekly/monthly/yearly patterns  
- Forecasting method comparisons  
- Error analysis  
- Reflections and insights  

### `forecast_system.py`
Main Python script that:
- Loads the generated dataset  
- Computes statistical patterns  
- Runs forecasting models  
- Creates visualizations  
- Prints the forecast summary  

### `data/historical_volumes.csv`
Automatically generated dataset containing 3 years (1,095 days) of volume data.

### `volume_analysis.png`
Visualization of trends, weekly patterns, and monthly patterns generated by the script.

## How to Run
